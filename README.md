# CMCU-Hackathon-2025
Building a tarot-themed RNBO (+ MAX/MSP) guitar pedal based on a past-present-future spread.

## Ideas:

Past -> Drone (not influenced by the guitar signal)
Present -> Distortion/Saturation
Future -> Delay/Reverb


### Physical interface to be based on tapping cards. RNBO patch will export to a Rasp. Pi.
